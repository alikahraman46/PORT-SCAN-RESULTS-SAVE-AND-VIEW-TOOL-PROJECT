1. Introduction
1.1 Project Name

Port Scanning and Management Application (PortScan Manager)

1.2 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a web application using the Django framework. The application will be able to scan for open ports on an internal network and store and manage the results in a central database. This project is a personal learning initiative to gain experience with the software development lifecycle, including requirements analysis, design, and testing, while also building practical skills in Python and Django.

1.3 Scope

The application will be developed using the Django web framework. Its core functionality will include scanning a specified range of IP addresses for open ports, presenting the scan results in a user interface (UI), and persisting this data in a database for later review.

2. User Stories and Features
This section outlines the application's key features from a user's perspective.

2.1 Scanning Functionality

User Story: As a user, I want to initiate a port scan for a specific IP address or a range of addresses I define.

Features:

The ability to input a single IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and a port range.

The ability to input an IP address range (e.g., 192.168.1.1-100) and a port range.

A "Start Scan" button to begin the scanning process.

2.2 Results Visualization

User Story: Once a scan is complete, I want to see the open ports, their corresponding services, and the scan's timestamp.

Features:

A dedicated page to list all scan results.

Each scan record should display the IP address, port number, service information (if available), status (open/closed), and the date of the scan.

2.3 Data Management

User Story: I want to save all my scan results in a database so I can review them at any time.

Features:

Creation of a Django model to properly structure and store scan results.

The ability to list, view details of, and delete past scan records.

2.4 User Interface (UI)

User Story: I want the application to have a simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.

Features:

A dedicated form page for entering scan parameters.

A results page that displays scan data in a clean, readable table.

A straightforward navigation menu (e.g., Home, Scan, Results) for easy access to different sections.

3. Technical Requirements
This section details the technical stack and architectural decisions for the application.

3.1 Development Environment

Language: Python 3.x

Web Framework: Django 4.x

Database: SQLite will be used during the development phase, with a potential migration to PostgreSQL or MySQL in a later stage.

Port Scanning Library: You can use Python's built-in socket library or a more advanced third-party library like python-nmap, which offers more robust scanning capabilities.

User Interface: The application will use Django's built-in Template Engine. Bootstrap or another CSS framework can be added to enhance the visual design.

3.2 Architecture

Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) Architecture: The project will adhere to Django's core architectural pattern.

Model: Defines the data structure (e.g., Scan, IP, Port).

View: Contains the business logic, written as functions or class-based views.

Template: The HTML files that render the front-end.

URL: The URL configuration that maps user requests to the appropriate Views.

4. Testing and Development Process
This section outlines the planned development and testing phases.

4.1 Development Phases

Requirements Analysis: Finalizing and reviewing this PRD.

Design: Creating the database schema and a basic UI wireframe.

Development: Implementing the models, views, and templates. Integrating the port scanning logic.

Testing: Verifying that the application functions as expected. Each feature should be tested individually (e.g., does the IP range scan work correctly? Is the data saved properly?).

Documentation: Creating basic documentation (e.g., a README.md file) to guide future setup and use of the project.

4.2 Test Scenarios

A valid IP address input should result in a successful scan.

An invalid IP address should trigger an error message for the user.

Scan results must be accurately saved to the database.

The saved data must be correctly displayed on the results listing page.

The application should clearly report the status if all ports in the range are closed.
